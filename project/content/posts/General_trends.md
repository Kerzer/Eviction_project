Welcome to the segment about general trends in the dataset. The main topic of this section will be to look at diference
between the boroughs to find common denoimnotors across of all of New York City, but also see which boroughs deviate the most.
If you have not seen the boroughs in the map [go back](https://kerzer.github.io/posts/map/) and enable the right layout in the
drop down menu.

The first step is to loot at the general eviction count for each year. The general trend is less evictions each year, which
is a very good trend but clearly something happend in [2020](https://kerzer.github.io/posts/2020/) which is explained in a different
sub story.

For a more in-depth explanation of why evictions are taking place and search for information  led to the find of
the boroughs from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_of_New_York_City) of New York
City. These boroughs are interesting in relation to evictions are attributes that describes the neighbourhoods. Here two important
are attributes are the wealth (GDP) and population type and density. <br>

Initial comprisons can be made between Manhatten and The Bronx which are the two immediately neighbouring boroughs,
with compareable population sizes. By comparing the number of [evictions](https://kerzer.github.io//evictions.png) which can
be seen on the [map](https://kerzer.github.io/posts/map/) they lie on oppsite
ends with the number of evictions happending. Considering the earlier mentioned attributes, which can be seen below, the 
density and wealth in Manhatten is vastly out ranking all other boroughs. A simple initial explantion is that Manhatten
is the downtown of New York City.

To mention a few world renowned attractions and institutions found on Manhatten [Wall Street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wall+St,+New+York,+NY,+USA/@40.720791,-73.9996339,14.25z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c25a165bedccab:0x2cb2ddf003b5ae01!8m2!3d40.7060361!4d-74.0088256),
[Times Square](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Times+Square/@40.7574645,-73.9869094,16.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c25855c6480299:0x55194ec5a1ae072e!8m2!3d40.7579747!4d-73.9855426),
and [Boardway](https://www.broadway.com/) are the three first of a [long list](https://www.nyctourist.com/nyc-most-popular-attractions-map) of places in Manhatten which is commonly known even
to most people in Denmark. Manhatten is clearly **the** place to be, which also explains why eviction rates are low,
as this is a place of high barrier of entry and people are less like to enter without already being part of a more
wealthy segement of the society.

The largest section of people in Manhatten is also white people while The Bronx is mainly
Afro-american in this poor borough. This enforces an idea that rich white americans
live in Manhatten while The Bronx is an area for the poor americans, since the white section abused the slave
labour of the Afro-american population, they are still recouping this fact. Since the other boroughs also abosorb the
remaning white population it is clear a larger portion of Afro-americans belong in the poor section of americans
versus other section of the population. It is clear however the majority of any racial section in New York are found
in more average conditions found by looking at Queens and Brooklyn. These boroughs represent the more
average normal life found for an american living in a larger city.

**This section is yikes, i do not know what to say though**


The interesting addtion of Staten Island to New York seem like an outlier. The density and wealth is the lowest for any
of the boroughs in New York City, however the number of evictions is still very low. The geograpical location of Staten
Island plays in here, with the distance to what is considered New York downtown. Staten Island eviction count is apporaching a
more how a rural community experiences evictions, where the turnover of homes is lower. The willingness to remove homeowners is then lower as
it is harder to replace them than in the other boroughs which relates to a different ecosystem. This is also supported by
lookinig at how many renters are present in Staten Island compared to all other boroughs.
