Our data analysis and visualization are based on the evictions dataset of New York that lists pending, scheduled,
and executed evictions within the five boroughs from 2017 to the present. 
There are some advantages of the figures shown in the visualization part. 
* First, the visualization has advanced interactivity so that users can easily select the results they are more interested in according to their wishes.
* Second, to attract the viewer's attention, we try our best to adopt a more beautiful
and straightforward way to present the results. 
* Third, we would like to tell the story more in detail.
 In other words, we would like to include more helpful information in our visualization so the users will save more time in reading.

However, machine learning is still missing in our data analysis. As can be seen from the information of the dataset, few numerical columns can be used for analysis, and most of them are coding of buildings or location. Therefore, most methods of machine learning are not suitable for the evictions dataset. If we want to get deeper insights into the evictions data, we have to find more additional data to get supports. Unfortunately, there are no open sources in the database. Also, the ways of visualization are restricted due to the dataset.
