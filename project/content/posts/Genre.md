*Visual narrative* tactics are visual applications which can be used to assist the narrative, which is  further subdivided into three segregated sections: visual structuring, highlighting, and transition guidance. We will introduce the tools that we use for data visualization from each of three categories.  
> - **Visual structuring:** The concept of visual structuring is related to the narrative structure, and it allows viewers to identify their position within the larger organization of the visualization. In this category, we use _Consistent Visual Platform_ as the main tool to present results, which is the common choice of techniques under visual structuring. The user only need to 
change the content within each panel while leaving the general layout of the visual elements intact. Therefore, adopting consistent visual platform is a more
active way between storytellers and viewers.
> - **Highlighting:** Highlighting refers to visual mechanisms that help the viewer rectify particular elements in the display. _Feature Distinction_ is commonly used to visualize data. By this way, users can clearly see what is the
most important features in the visualization.
> - **Transition guidance:** It talks about the techniques for moving within or between visual scenes without confusing the viewer. _Object Continuity_ is a widely-used technique, and it enables the visualization to tell a complete story in a more standard way.

Also, the *narrative structure* tactics is used to assist and facilitate the narrative. We would like to implement this kind of tools from three aspects: ordering, interactivity, and messaging.

> - **Ordering:** _Ordering_ refers to the methods of arranging the path viewers take through the data visualization. _Random Access_ is the way we used on the grounds we will analyze the dataset from different perspectives. 
> - **Interactivity:** _Interactivity_ refers to the different ways a viewer can manipulate the visualization. We visualize the data by implementing _Filtering/Selection/Search so that the users can easily select the specific results of data they want. 
> - **Messaging:** It is a way about visualization communicating theories and commentary to the viewer. _Captions/Headlines_ are adopted in our figures in order to present the main idea or way of the visualization. Therefore, viewers can have better understanding of visualized results.
