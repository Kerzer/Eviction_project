In this section the yearly trend found in the [map](https://kerzer.github.io/posts/map/) is explained in greater detail.

Looking at the eviction count for the year 2020 it is alot lower than the previous years. The main reason for this is that 
evctions [were stopped by the goverment](https://ny.curbed.com/2020/3/16/21180842/coronavirus-new-york-state-eviction-moratorium)
because of [Covid-19](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) which struck New York City early on in the pandemic.
Because of the need to stop the spread, [isolation orders](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-provider-quarantine-precautions.pdf)
was issued by the state to avoid the spread running rampant. This lead reduction in the number of evictions.
